## üéì Workshop Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Employee Onboarding Dashboard
**Objective:** Build an intelligent onboarding tracker that identifies at-risk new hires

**Endpoints to Use:**
1. `/hr/onboarding` - Get onboarding records
2. `/hr/workers/:id` - Enrich with employee details
3. `/hr/workers/:id/performance` - Add performance context

**UiPath Implementation:**
```
1. Create API Workflow in Studio Web
2. GET onboarding records
3. For Each onboarding record:
   - GET employee details
   - Calculate progress percentage
   - Identify risks (low completion, delayed tasks)
4. Generate dashboard with recommendations
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- List of at-risk onboardings with specific action items
- Progress metrics and bottleneck identification
- Automated alerts for HR managers

### Scenario 2: Invoice Approval Automation
**Objective:** Implement intelligent invoice routing based on amount and vendor risk

**Endpoints to Use:**
1. `/finance/invoices` - Get pending invoices
2. `/finance/vendors/performance` - Check vendor risk
3. `/finance/invoices/:id/approve` - Approve invoices

**Business Rules:**
- < $5,000: Auto-approve if vendor risk is low
- $5,000 - $25,000: Route to manager
- > $25,000: Route to C-level
- High-risk vendor: Always manual review

### Scenario 3: Customer Health Monitoring
**Objective:** Calculate customer health scores and prevent churn

**Endpoints to Use:**
1. `/crm/customers` - Get customer base
2. `/crm/support/tickets` - Check support issues
3. `/analytics/customer/relationships` - Get engagement metrics
4. `/crm/renewals` - Check renewal risk

**Health Score Calculation:**
```javascript
baseScore = 75
- (openTickets * 8)
- (daysSinceContact / 2)
- (renewalRisk === 'High' ? 25 : 0)
+ (engagementScore * 5)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Data Structure Examples

#### Employee Object
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-here",
  "descriptor": "John Smith",
  "primaryWorkEmail": "john.smith@company.com",
  "isActive": true,
  "department": "R&D",
  "primaryJob": {
    "title": "Senior Engineer",
    "level": "Senior",
    "salary": 95000
  },
  "managerId": "manager-uuid",
  "location": "San Francisco"
}
```

#### Invoice Object
```json
{
  "id": "INV-84521",
  "vendorName": "Tech Solutions Inc",
  "amount": 12500.00,
  "status": "pending",
  "dueDate": "2025-09-15",
  "category": "Software"
}
```

## üîÑ Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Data Enrichment
Combine multiple endpoints to create comprehensive views:
```
GET /hr/workers ‚Üí GET /hr/performance ‚Üí GET /hr/onboarding
Result: Complete employee profile with performance and onboarding status
```

### Pattern 2: Filtering Pattern
For endpoints marked "Requires UiPath Filtering":
```vb
' In UiPath Studio
DataTable.Select("[status] = 'pending' AND [amount] > 5000")
```

### Pattern 3: Approval Workflows
```
1. GET /finance/invoices (status = 'pending')
2. Apply business rules
3. PATCH /finance/invoices/:id/approve
4. Send notifications
```

## üìà Workshop Success Metrics

Track your automation success:
- **Response Time**: Target < 500ms per endpoint
- **Error Rate**: Should be < 1%
- **Data Quality**: 700+ realistic records
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CORS Errors**
- The API has CORS enabled for all origins
- If issues persist, check your UiPath proxy settings

**Empty Responses**
- Verify the endpoint URL includes `/api` prefix
- Check if filtering is required (see endpoint table)

**Connection Timeouts**
- Default timeout is 30 seconds
- For local development, ensure port 4000 is available
