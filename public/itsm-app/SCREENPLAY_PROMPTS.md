User: A developer is asking me to restart the payment processing service to fix a memory leak. Our change policy says:

"Production services handling financial transactions require CAB approval for planned changes."

It's 3 PM on a Thursday. Can I do this restart now or do I need approval first?
```

### Runbook Scenarios

2. Check Network Connectivity
3. Verify Credentials
4. Clear VPN Cache

```

### KB Article Scenarios

8. **KB Didn't Work**
```
User: I followed KB-001 for VPN troubleshooting but step 4 doesn't work. The KB says:

"Step 4: Navigate to C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Cisco\AnyConnect and delete the cache folder."

The folder doesn't exist on this user's machine. They're running Windows 11.
```

### Vendor Advisory Scenarios

9. **Microsoft Advisory**
```
User: Microsoft just released this advisory and I have users reporting print issues:

Security Advisory: KB5034441
Issue: Print jobs fail with error 0x0000011b after February 2025 update
Workaround: Add registry key to disable CVE mitigation

Is this related to our print issues? Our users are on Windows 11 23H2.
