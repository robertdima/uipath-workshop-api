                           TROUBLESHOOTING NOTES
================================================================================

ISSUE 1: IPsec Connection Failed (Error 809)
--------------------------------------------
- UDP ports 500 and 4500 appear to be blocked
- Likely cause: Home router firewall blocking IPsec traffic
- SSL fallback was successful, indicating server is reachable

Recommendation:
1. Configure home router to allow UDP 500/4500 outbound
2. Or continue using SSL fallback (less optimal performance)

ISSUE 2: Authentication Failed (Error 691)
------------------------------------------
- SSL connection successful
- Certificate validation passed
- RADIUS authentication rejected

Possible causes:
1. Incorrect password
2. Account locked in Active Directory
3. MFA token out of sync
4. Account disabled or expired

Recommendation:
1. Verify AD account status
2. Reset password if recently changed
3. Re-sync MFA token
4. Contact IT if issue persists
