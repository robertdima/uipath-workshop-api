**Category:** Identity
**Applies To:** All Active Directory Users
**Last Updated:** 2025-02-12
**Author:** Identity Management Team

## Overview

This article outlines the standard procedure for resetting user passwords in Active Directory, including identity verification requirements and security protocols.

## Identity Verification Requirements

Before resetting any password, verify user identity using ONE of these methods:

| Method | Verification Steps |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Manager Approval** | Email confirmation from user's direct manager |
| **Security Questions** | 3 of 5 pre-registered questions answered correctly |
| **Video Call** | Face verification via Teams with badge visible |
| **In-Person** | Physical badge verification at IT Help Desk |

**SECURITY NOTICE:** Never reset a password based solely on a phone call or chat message claiming to be the user.

## Standard Reset Procedure

### Step 1: Verify Identity
Follow identity verification requirements above. Document method used.

### Step 2: Check Account Status
```powershell
Get-ADUser -Identity "username" -Properties LockedOut, Enabled, PasswordExpired, PasswordLastSet |
    Select-Object Name, LockedOut, Enabled, PasswordExpired, PasswordLastSet
```

### Step 3: Unlock Account (if locked)
```powershell
Unlock-ADAccount -Identity "username"
```

### Step 4: Reset Password
```powershell
# Generate secure temporary password
$TempPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString "Acme2025!Temp" -AsPlainText -Force

# Reset password with "must change" flag
Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity "username" -NewPassword $TempPassword -Reset
Set-ADUser -Identity "username" -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true
```

### Step 5: Communicate Securely
Provide temporary password via:
- **Preferred:** SMS to registered mobile number
- **Alternate:** Encrypted email to personal email on file
- **Last Resort:** Verbally during verified video call

**NEVER** send passwords via:
- Unencrypted email
- Chat/Teams message
- Voicemail

### Step 6: Document in Ticket
Record:
- Identity verification method used
- Account status before reset
- Timestamp of reset
- Communication method for temp password

## Self-Service Password Reset

Direct users to self-service portal when possible:
- URL: https://passwordreset.acme-corp.com
- Requires: Registered MFA device
- Available: 24/7

## Special Cases

### VIP/Executive Accounts
- Require manager AND security team approval
- Must use video call verification
- Escalate to Identity Manager for completion

### Service Accounts
- NO self-service resets
- Requires Change Request (CAB approval for production)
- Coordinate with application owner

### Privileged Accounts (Admin)
- Requires Security team involvement
- Two-person verification required
- Audit logging mandatory

## Troubleshooting

### "Password does not meet complexity requirements"
Ensure password contains:
- Minimum 12 characters
- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- At least one number
- At least one special character
- Not similar to previous 12 passwords

### "Account is locked out"
```powershell
# Find lockout source
Get-ADUser -Identity "username" -Properties LockedOut, BadLogonCount, LastBadPasswordAttempt
Search-ADAccount -LockedOut | Where-Object {$_.SamAccountName -eq "username"}
```

### "User cannot change password at next logon"
```powershell
# Verify flag is set
Get-ADUser -Identity "username" -Properties PasswordNeverExpires, CannotChangePassword
```
