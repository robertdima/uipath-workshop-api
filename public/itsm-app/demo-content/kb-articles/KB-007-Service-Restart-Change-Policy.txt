**Category:** Policy
**Applies To:** All IT Staff
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-20
**Author:** IT Governance Team
**Policy Reference:** POL-002

## Overview

This article defines when Change Advisory Board (CAB) approval is required for service restarts and related actions in production environments.

## Change Classification Matrix

### Standard Changes (No CAB Required)

These actions can be performed with proper documentation:

| Action | Conditions | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Application Pool Recycle | Single server, outside business hours | IIS AppPool restart |
| Non-critical Service Restart | Non-production, documented procedure | Dev environment services |
| Log Rotation | Automated, no service impact | Windows Event Log archive |
| Cache Clear | No service interruption | Redis cache flush (non-prod) |

### Normal Changes (CAB Required)

Submit change request 3 business days in advance:

| Action | Conditions | Approval |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Production Service Restart | Any production service | CAB + App Owner |
| Scheduled Maintenance | Planned downtime | CAB |
| Configuration Change | Production configs | CAB + Change Manager |
| Patch Deployment | Non-emergency patches | CAB |

### Emergency Changes (Expedited CAB)

For critical issues requiring immediate action:

| Action | Conditions | Approval |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Emergency Service Restart | Active incident, P1/P2 | Incident Manager + On-call CAB |
| Hotfix Deployment | Security vulnerability | Security Lead + Emergency CAB |
| Rollback | Failed deployment | Change Manager verbal approval |

## Decision Tree: Do I Need CAB Approval?

```
Is this a PRODUCTION environment?
├── NO → Standard Change (document in ticket)
└── YES → Is there an active P1/P2 incident?
    ├── YES → Emergency Change (get IM approval, document retroactively)
    └── NO → Is this during maintenance window?
        ├── YES → Was it pre-approved in change calendar?
        │   ├── YES → Proceed (reference CHG number)
        │   └── NO → Submit Normal Change
        └── NO → Does this cause user impact?
            ├── YES → Submit Normal Change (3-day lead time)
            └── NO → Is this a documented Standard Change?
                ├── YES → Proceed (reference runbook)
                └── NO → Submit Normal Change
```
