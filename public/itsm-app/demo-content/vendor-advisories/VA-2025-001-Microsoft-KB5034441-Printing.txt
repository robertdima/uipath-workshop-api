wusa /uninstall /kb:5034441 /quiet /norestart
shutdown /r /t 60 /c "Restart required to complete KB removal"
```

### Option 2: Use Type 4 Printer Driver
1. Remove existing printer
2. Download Type 4 (V4) driver from manufacturer
3. Install using V4 driver package
4. Re-add printer

### Option 3: Direct IP Printing
If using print server, switch to direct IP:
1. Remove network printer
2. Add printer using TCP/IP port
3. Enter printer's IP address directly

## Permanent Fix
