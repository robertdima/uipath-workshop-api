# Vendor Advisory: VA-2025-002

## Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

**Advisory ID:** VA-2025-002
**Vendor:** Cisco
**Published:** 2025-01-28
**Updated:** 2025-02-05
**Severity:** Critical (CVSS 8.8)
**CVE:** CVE-2025-20189

---

## Summary

A vulnerability in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

## Affected Products

| Product | Affected Versions | Fixed Version |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client (Windows) | < 4.10.08029 | 4.10.08029+ |
| Cisco Secure Client (Windows) | < 5.1.3.62 | 5.1.3.62+ |

**Not Affected:**
- macOS clients
- Linux clients
- Mobile clients (iOS/Android)

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly validate DLL file signatures before loading. An attacker with local access could exploit this by placing a crafted DLL in a location that the AnyConnect client searches during execution.

### Attack Vector
1. Attacker gains local user access to Windows system
2. Attacker places malicious DLL in user-writable directory
3. User initiates VPN connection
4. AnyConnect loads malicious DLL with SYSTEM privileges
5. Attacker gains full system control

### CVSS Score Breakdown
```
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
Base Score: 8.8 (High)
```

## Indicators of Compromise

Check for suspicious DLLs:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\ProgramData\Cisco" -Filter "*.dll" -Recurse |
    Where-Object { $_.VersionInfo.CompanyName -ne "Cisco Systems, Inc." }
```

Event Log signature:
```
Log: Application
Source: AnyConnect
Event ID: 1000
Message contains: "Failed to verify signature"
```

## Mitigation

### Immediate (Before Patching)
1. Restrict local admin rights
2. Enable application whitelisting
3. Monitor DLL loads via EDR
